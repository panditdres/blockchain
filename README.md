> Small blockchain exercise to understand how one is built and the different implementation needed to build one.

## Installation

npm version `5.6.0`. Node version `v6.2.2`

```
npm install
```

## Usage example

There are two programs that can be run to test and see how the implementation works. `basic.js` focuses on adding blocks within a chain and checks whether the chain is valid. Pieces of code included in order to see what happens if a block is tampered after adding it to the chain and checks whether the validity of the latter is still intact.

Use `node basic.js` to run the program.

`main.js` focuses on transactions and pending transactions. Methods included replicates how one would transfer data from one address to another address. In this case, using coins as an example. Included is the validation of the chain and checks on whether blocks have been tampered or not.

Use `node main.js` to run the program.
